      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Me: active dreamer, inspired creative, food lover and social being with a penchant for adventure. When not shuffing among the countless windows that eternally occupy my laptop screen, you'll most likely find me strategizing new ways to tackle whatever the rock climb du jour may be, exploring my new California playground, or lost in the aisles of some wonderful grocery store. </p>
      <p>What makes me tick: family, friends, beautiful technology, and the limitless opportunities for positive change through creative solutions. With my appreciation of good company comes a strong preference for (obsession with?) great food, and I am always open to a nice glass of wine. Fiercely motivated and competitive with myself, I am forever pushing to reach new limits, both professionally as a marketer and personally as a rock climber and friend. All rumors of my intense love of cheese, donuts, French macarons and elephants are entirely accurate.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Though my heart will always belong to my hometown of Chicago and the city that was my childhood backyard, the full "me" is truly made up of all the beautiful places that I've been able to travel to in my life. From trips around America to my greater adventures in Europe, Asia, Israel and Australia, I have picked up little characteristics from each of the cultures that I have visited and explored over the years. Most currently, I am working on nailing the whole "cool California kid" thing... naturally, the overwhelming appreciation for fresh food out here has made this transition feel pretty seamless.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>Never found without...</h2>
      <p>...a tin of miniature altoids, a pair of climbing shoes in my trunk, loose chalk, my old Nikon FM3, lemon water, a snack, my moleskine planner, and some crazy idea or marketing scheme floating around in the forefront of my mind.</p>
      <h2>Currently works at...</h2>
     <p>...Intuit, as a rotational developmental program associate. Though my formal classroom training is in child development and entrepreneurial leadership, I found a real education in the business experiences that I have put myself into over the past decade. From public relations and tech accelerator operations to economic consulting and experience in co-founding a micro-seed angel syndicate fund, I have aggressively networked my way into a wide variety of business situations, and (ultimately) all roads have led to the wonderful company that is Intuit. My current project lies with the direct response marketing in TurboTax, where I have had the exceptional opportunity to work in a truly cross-functional environment; starting in May, I will be making the move up to Mountain View to start working within Intuit's small business group. Independently, I am developing my coding and analytics skills to push one step closer to becoming a genuinely self-sufficient marketer. More adventures and professional tales to come!</p>
      <h2>Always searching for...</h2>
      <p>...the newest technological advancements (I'm a shameless early adotper), an intriguing recipe for something delicious, the next travel destination to put on my list, the best donut in town, a new rock to climb on, the sound of rain hitting the ocean, and elephants.</p>

		<p><span class="bold-first">Me:</span> active dreamer, inspired creative, food lover and social being with a penchant for adventure. When not shuffing among the countless windows that eternally occupy my laptop screen, you'll most likely find me strategizing new ways to tackle the rock climb du jour, exploring my new California playground, or lost in the aisles of some wonderful grocery store.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><span class="bold-first">What makes me tick:</span> family, friends, beautiful technology, and the limitless opportunities for positive change through creative solutions. With my appreciation of good company comes an insurmountable passion for great food, and I am always open to a nice glass of wine. All rumors of my intense love of cheese, donuts, macarons and elephants are entirely accurate.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><span class="bold-first">Currently works at:</span> Intuit, as a rotational developmental program marketing associate. I have already had the opportunity to dig into direct response marketing (with a specific focus in automations) with the TurboTax team, and am currently working with QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions in product marketing and go-to-market planning; both teams have fueled my enthusiasm for cross-functional work and lean testing, and continue to inspire me to take bigger swings and bolder moves daily. Independently, I am developing my coding and analytics skills to push one step closer to becoming a genuinely self-sufficient marketer. Please don't hesitate to reach out or visit my LinkedIn for a closer look at my experience and rather atypical path to present.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><span class="bold-first">Never found without:</span> a tin of miniature altoids, a pair of climbing shoes in my trunk, loose chalk, my old Nikon FM3, lemon water, a piece of fruit, my moleskine planner, and some crazy idea or marketing scheme floating around in the forefront of my mind.</p>
